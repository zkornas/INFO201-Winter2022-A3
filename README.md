# Assignment 3: Incarceration
In this assignment, you'll create the necessary files to perform the analysis described on Canvas (including `analysis.R`, `index.Rmd`, and by _knitting_ your document, an `index.html` file).

**Important**: Be sure to publish your site prior to the assignment due date, to test that your webserver is working correctly.

###  Notes
#### File organization
* The `analysis.R` file and, if needed, other data analysis or visualization files should be placed in your `/source` directory.
* The `index.Rmd` and, if needed, other `.Rmd` and `.HTML` files should go into the `/docs`

#### Webserver set-up
* Once you have completed your report, make sure to **change your repository settings** so that you can view the hosted website.
